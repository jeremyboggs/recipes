# Cinnamon Roll Cookies

From [The Virtual Goody
Plate](http://virtualgoodyplate.blogspot.com/2009/12/cinnamon-roll-cookies-by-kat.html)

## Ingredients

**Filling:**

-   1/2 cup white sugar
-   2 T cinnamon

**Dough:**

-   3 cups all-purpose flour
-   2 tsp baking powder
-   1 tsp cinnamon
-   1/2 tsp salt
-   1 cup unsalted butter, softened
-   1 cup packed brown sugar
-   2 eggs
-   1 tsp vanilla

**Icing:**

-   1 cup sifted powdered sugar
-   1/4 cup warm water (called for but use WAY less)
-   1/2 tsp powdered egg whites (Usually in the baking aisle in a
    canister. It helps the icing dry hard. It's OK to skip it, but the
    iced cookies won't be stackable.)

## Directions

1. For the dough, sift flour, baking powder, cinnamon and salt together.
Cream butter and brown sugar. Add eggs and vanilla; mix until
incorporated. With mixer on low speed, add dry ingredients, blending
just to incorporate; do not overmix!

2. Trace a 9x16-inch rectangle on a sheet of parchment or wax paper. Pat
dough into the rectangle using your hands, then sprinkle half of the
cinnamon sugar over the dough.

-   This dough is sticky! I found it easiest to roll the dough into the
    rectangle by putting a piece of wax paper on top and then rolling
    the dough in a "wax paper sandwich." I worked quickly, but I found
    it necessary to refrigerate the dough for 30 minutes before trying
    to roll it into the log shape. Totall worth the extra step.

3. Roll the dough into a log, beginning on the LONG side and using the
wax paper to help you. Dust the outside of log with remaining
cinnamon-sugar mixture. Wrap log in plastic wrap and chill for at least
3 hours.

4. Preheat oven to 350. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper (or
use baking mat.) Slice chilled dough into 1/2-inch disks and place on
prepared baking sheets 1 inch apart. Bake 10-12 minutes or until golden.
Cool on pan for 5 minutes, then transfer to a rack.

5. Combine icing ingredients in a bowl (icing will be thin -
UNDERSTATEMENT OF THE YEAR! Next time I will use WAY less water - with
1/4 cup, the icing was too thin to even show up on the cookie!) Drizzle
over cooled cookies; let stand at room temperature until icing dries.
Makes 30-32 cookies.
