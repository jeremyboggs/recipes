# Jer-Jer-Jerky

My own evolving jerky recipe.

## Ingredients

-   2-3 lbs. Beef (I use London broil, but any lean beef should work)
-   3 cups Worcestershire sauce.
-   1 cup sherry cooking wine
-   2 Tbs coarse pepper
-   1 bottle [Country Bob's All Purpose
    Sauce](http://www.countrybobs.com/)

## Directions

-   Slightly freeze meat to make it easier to cut. Slice against grain
    to make 1/4 in. thin strips. Trim off visible fat.
-   Combine remaining ingredients in a medium bowl until mixed
    thoroughly.
-   Place meat and marinade in large resealable bag and marinade 24-48
    hours.
-   Dry meat in dehydrator or oven 4-8 hours until done.
