# Fried Chicken Bites

From [Biscuits and
Such](http://biscuitsandsuch.com/2009/09/18/fried-chicken-bites/)

## Ingredients

-   3 chicken breasts
-   2 cups buttermilk
-   1 cup bread crumbs
-   1 cup flour
-   1/2 tbsp paprika
-   1 tbsp cayenne
-   1/2 tbsp chipotle
-   1/2 tbsp garlic powder
-   1/2 tbsp red pepper flakes
-   1/2 tbsp pepper
-   1/4 tbsp salt
-   Peanut oil

## Directions

Cut the chicken in strips or bites, your choice. Place in a
bag/bowl/container. Pour buttermilk over and add half of the spices.
Soak overnight.

Toast the bread and then dice it. Put in the food processor with the
rest of the spices. Blend until you have bread crumbs. Mix with flour.

In a large skillet, heat your oil. Youâ€™ll know when your oil is hot
enough if bubbles form around a wooden spoon.

Dredge each piece of chicken in the flour mixture. Fry for 4-5 minutes,
then turn. Fry an additional 4-5 minutes, or until golden brown.
