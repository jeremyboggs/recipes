# Charlenes Chili

1.  REDIRECT [Charlene's Chili](Charlene's%20Chili)
hup
-   2tbs chili powder, plus more to taste
-   2 tbs paprika
-   salt and pepper, to taste

## Directions

Cook hamburger in water until done, around 20 minutes. Drain, leaving
just enough water to help mix ingredients. Stir in remaining
ingredients.

## Variations

I usually make this with 1lb. of hamburger, and I only add 1/4 of what
the ingredients call for, except for chili powder (i add almost 1tbs).
