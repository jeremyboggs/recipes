# Getting Started with Social Media

Notes and resources for getting started with social media. Targeted
mainly at academics and educators, particularly in the humanities and
social sciences, but could easily be applied in other areas.

## What is Social Media?

Social media is essentially media that are produce and consumed
socially, through a variety of online networks and services. The formats
of this media are widely variedâ€”longer articles, 140-character snippets
of text, video, audio, images. Authorship often takes a backseat; It
usually is less important who says something first than who says
something useful and meaningful.

    Wikipedia

    2.0](http://oreilly.com/web2/archive/what-is-web-20.html)

### Issues of Attention

Attention is a valuable resource in a culture increasingly drawn to and
utilizing social media. With the overwhelming availability of
information in the digital age, it becomes even more important to create
methods and tools for filtering information in a way.

-   [Attention
    Literacy](http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/rheingold/detail?entry_id=38828)
    by [Harold Rheingold](http://www.rheingold.com/). See in general
    Rheingold's [Social Media Classroom
    syllabus](http://socialmediaclassroom.com/vircom09/lockedwiki/main-page).

    not to blog. Rebuttal by [Timothy
    Burke](http://weblogs.swarthmore.edu/burke/2005/07/10/the-trouble-with-tribble/).

## Toolkit

My recommended social media "toolkit" consists of the following:

-   Personal Site - [ClioWeb](http://clioweb.org). Self-hosted, uses
    [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) blog software for the weblog, and
    [MediaWiki](http://mediawiki.org) for the wiki.
-   Microblogging - [Twitter](http://twitter.com). I'm
    [clioweb](http://twitter.com/clioweb).
-   Bookmarking - [Delicious](http://delicious.com), a free, web-based
    social bookmarking service. I'm
    [clioweb](http://delicious.com/clioweb)
-   Citations/Bibliographies - [Zotero](http://zotero.org), a free
    browser plugin and web services for storing and sharing
    bibliographies and notes. I'm [clioweb](http://zotero.org/clioweb).
    (Seeing a pattern, here?)
-   Images - [Flickr](http://flickr.com), a free, web-based photo
    sharing services. Can add notes, organize photos into sets and
    collections, and geotag photos.
-   Video - [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com), a free services for uploading and
    sharing video.
-   Presentations - [SlideShare](http://slideshare.net) lets you upload
    a variety of presentation types and share them on the web.
-   Cloud Publishing - [Google Docs](http://docs.google.com). Write
    papers, create spreadsheets, presentations, and forms, or upload any
    file to view. Great for group writing projects, collecting
    information quickly, and accessing that work on any computer with an
    internet connection.
-   [Firefox browser](http://firefox.com).

## Specific Services and Tools

### Twitter

**"Twitter to connect, blogs to reflect."** Use Twitter as a way to find
and connect with other people with similar interests. Follow their
tweets, send responses. Use Twitter as a backchannel or reporting
mechanism for conferences. Organize meetings. Twitter in academia is
increasingly about finding and working with other academics.

-   "Microblogging": Limited to 140 characters.
-   Can "@" other users to send them public messages.
-   Tweets can be "retweeted", so you send useful tweet by one person
    you're following to your entire list of followers. Helps expand
    network, opens conversations.
    -   Retweets make up a rough "editorship" of posts aggregated at
        [Digital History Now](http://dhnow.org). [Dan
        Cohen](http://dancohen.org) argues that *Digital History Now* is
        a "real-time, crowdsourced publication" that "takes the pulse of
        the digital humanities community" from Twitter. Links that are
        retweeted frequently get aggregated to the site. More
        explanation on [Dan Cohen's
        blog](http://www.dancohen.org/2009/11/18/introducing-digital-humanities-now/).

-   Can follow hash tags
    -   Has been used to extend conversations to interested users who,
        for example, can't attend conferences:
        -   [\#AHA2010](http://twitter.com/#search?q=%23AHA2010)
        -   [\#MLA09](http://twitter.com/#search?q=%23MLA09)
        -   [\#thatcamp](http://twitter.com/#search?q=%23thatcamp)

-   Amanda French has argued that Twitter amounts to an [amplification
    of scholarly
    communication](http://amandafrench.net/2009/12/30/make-10-louder/).

**Applications**

Twitter is one service where the applications built for it are much
better than its own website. A host of applications and services are
built on Twitter using their API. I use several applications for
using/viewing Twitter feeds:

-   Desktop - [TweetDeck](http://tweetdeck.com/). Lets you add and
    organize columns of feeds, subscribe to hash tag searches, and
    manage multiple Twitter accounts in one application
-   Mobile - [Echofon](http://echofon.com/twitter/iphone/) iPhone app.

**Issues/Discussions**

-   [Twittering the Student
    Experience](http://newsletter.alt.ac.uk/xrctg5ovlfkimsphpsy77s)
-   [Academics and Social Media: MLA09 and
    Twitter](http://www.profhacker.com/2010/01/09/academics-and-social-media-mla09-and-twitter/)

**Getting Started**

-   Sign up for a free account at [Twitter](http://twitter.com).
-   Follow some people!
    -   [Me!](http://twitter.com/clioweb)
    -   [dancohen](http://twitter.com/dancohen) (Dan Cohen)
    -   [foundhistory](http://twitter.com/foundhistory) (Tom
        Scheinfeldt)
    -   [amandafrench](http://twitter.com/amandafrench) (Amanda French)
    -   [ninaksimon](http://twitter.com/ninaksimon) (Nina K. Simon)

    -   [smithsonian](http://twitter.com/smithsonian) (Smithsonian
        Institute)

You can find plenty of more folks by area or discipline on We Follow by
tag: [digital humanities](http://wefollow.com/tag/digitalhumanities),
[museum](http://wefollow.com/tag/museum),
[library](http://wefollow.com/tag/library), and
[history](http://wefollow.com/tag/history).

Once you are following some people, watch the conversations regular for
a period of time (a week or two) to get a sense of how people use
Twitter to communicate. If the people you are following converse with
other users not on your following list. If any hash tags come up for
conferences or topics, follow them. Regardless of whether you are
following someone, or they're following you, you can always send them an
"@" message to start or contribute to a conversation!

### Weblogs and Newsfeeds

A website that provides regularly published entries, displayed in
reverse-chronological order. Usually includes a news feed, which allows
readers to subscribe and receive updates through a newsreader, and a
commenting system, which allows readers to leave comments associated
with a particular post.

-   Posts can be of any length.
-   Posts are published in reverse-chronological order, can be
    categorized and tagged.
-   Blogs include news feeds, which let you subscribe to many different
    blogs.
-   Lots of feed readers, on the web and on desktops/mobile devices,
    including:
    -   [Google Reader](http://google.com/reader/) a web-based feed
        reading service by Google. Lets you add feeds to categories,
        star and share posts with other users.
    -   [Bloglines](http://bloglines.com) a web-based service.
    -   [Thunderbird](http://thunderbird.com) Desktop email client that
        also includes a feedreader.
    -   [Sage](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/77), a
        Firefox addon for reading feeds.

#### Rationales

-   Dan Cohen's talk on Is Google Good for History at the 2010 AHA
    meeting had about 50 attendees, but well over 5000 readers on [his
    blog post with his
    remarks](http://www.dancohen.org/2010/01/07/is-google-good-for-history/).
    The post included comments from other Google representatives.
-   [Why I Blog Under My Own
    Name](http://otal.umd.edu/~mgk/blog/archives/000813.html) by Matt
    Kirschenbaum.
-   [A Domain of One's
    Own](http://bavatuesdays.com/a-domain-of-ones-own/) by Jim Groom.
    Argues for the usefulness of students having their own domain and
    web space, centered around a blog or wiki, for collecting individual
    work over the course of their college experience.

### Wikis

A wiki is a website that encourages easy creation and collaboration; A
collaborative writing space. Really is about drafting, revising,
reorganizing, and working in groups. Unstructured until individuals or
groups give it structure. Wiki is Hawaiian for "fast." This page itself
is a wiki, easy for me to update on the fly, keep versions.

-   Teaching
    -   [Prof. Brian Croxall's
        Wiki](http://briancroxall.pbwiki.com/Spring2009AmericanSurvey)
