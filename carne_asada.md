# Carne Asada

## Ingredients

-   2 medium lemons, juiced
-   6 Tbsp water
-   1 tsp garlic powder
-   1 scant tsp salt
-   1 lb skirt steak or flank steak
-   Vegetable oil for grilling

## Directions

In a large resealable bag, combine the first four ingredients and add
the beef, massaging the marinade into the meat. Refrigerate for 1-3
hours.

Heat a grill or grill pan on medium high. Remove the meat from the
marinade and pat it dry with paper towels. Lightly oil the hot grill and
add the beef. Cook until the meat is nicely charred and the interior is
just cooked through, about 3 minutes a side. Let rest a few minutes.
Slice the beef into 1/2-inch strips and then hack it into nubs. Makes
enough for 12 tacos.
