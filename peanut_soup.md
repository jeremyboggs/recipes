# West African Peanut Soup

## Ingredients

- 6 cups vegetable broth (I use garlic broth)
- 1 onion, finely diced
- 3-4 Tbsp fresh grated ginger
- 3-4 Tbsp fresh grated/minced garlic
- 1 tsp salt
- 4oz tomato paste
- 1 C peanut butter

## Directions

- In a large pot or dutch oven, cook the onion, ginger, and garlic in a bit of oil until translucent.
- Add the tomato paste and cook for a few minutes. Add the peanut butter, and combine well.
- Slowly add broth to the pot, and mix until smooth. Bring this to a summer.
- Add kale or some other greens of your choice and simmer 15 more minutes.

## Modifications

- Dice a sweet potato into 1/2 inch cubes and add to the soup, and simmer until soft.
- Add fried tofu, cilantro, and/or roasted eggplant
- Sriracha or some other hot sauce is always a good idea.
