## Cupcakes

### Ingredients

-   2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
-   2 teaspoons baking soda
-   2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
-   1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
-   1 teaspoon salt
-   1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, softened
-   2 cups sugar
-   2 large eggs
-   1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
-   4 cups coarsely shredded apples, such as Macintosh (about 1 3/4
    pounds)

### Directions

1.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line 2 standard muffin tins with paper
    liners; set aside. Whisk together flour, baking soda, cinnamon,
    nutmeg, and salt in a medium bowl; set aside.
2.  Put butter and sugar into the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with
    the paddle attachment; mix on medium-high speed until pale and
    fluffy, about 5 minutes. Mix in eggs and vanilla. Reduce speed to
    low; mix in apples. Add flour mixture; mix, scraping down sides of
    bowl as needed, until just combined.
3.  Divide batter among lined cups, filling halfway; bake until tops are
    springy to the touch, 18 to 20 minutes. Remove cupcakes from tins;
    transfer to a wire rack; let cool completely.
