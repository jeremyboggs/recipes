# Scrambled Eggs

Some rules for scrambling eggs. From [Dan Barber's Four Rules for
Perfect Scrambled
Eggs](http://blogs.menshealth.com/guy-gourmet/dan-barber%E2%80%99s-4-rules-for-perfect-scrambled-eggs/2011/03/14/)

> -   Rule \#1: Source smart - Great scrambled eggs start with a great
>     chicken. “For any chicken lucky enough to enjoy a pasture-based
>     diet, the beta-carotene in the grass enhances the color and the
>     flavor of the eggs’ yolks and your scrambled eggs,” Barber says.
>     Seek out pastured eggs at your local farmer’s market, or use Eat
>     Wild’s state-by-state directory.
> -   Rule \#2: Easy on the heat - “High heat is the enemy,” says
>     Barber. “To ensure creamy, soft—but not runny—scrambled eggs,
>     enlist the aid of a double boiler.” Don’t have one? A large,
>     non-stick pan set over low to medium-low heat is a good stand-in.
>     Crank the pan over high heat and you’ll have brown, rubbery eggs.
> -   Rule \#3: Enhance the eggs - Always opt for butter–it helps bring
>     out the natural creaminess of the eggs (cooking sprays will only
>     add a chemical note to the dish). A tablespoon or two of milk can
>     also help cook fluffier, more flavorful eggs. Just add the milk
>     during the first few seconds of cooking.
> -   Rule \#4: Finish them - Hold the ketchup. Perfectly cooked, fresh
>     eggs require little more than snipped soft herbs like parsley or
>     chives to brighten presentation and add subtle flavors, says
>     Barber.
