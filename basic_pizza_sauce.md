# Basic Pizza Sauce

From [Basic Pizza Sauce
Recipe](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/sara-moulton/basic-pizza-sauce-recipe/index.html)
from FoodNetwork.com

## Ingredients

-   1 can (28-ounces) whole peeled tomatoes, in juice
-   1 small white or sweet onion, finely diced and minced
-   1 clove garlic, peeled and minced
-   3 to 4 fresh basil leaves
-   1 teaspoon dried oregano
-   Pinch salt
-   Pinch fresh ground black pepper
-   Pinch sugar, optional
-   2 tablespoons olive oil, to saute

## Directions

Empty the contents of the tomato can in a mixing bowl and coarsely crush
the tomatoes with a fork or your hands, leaving them just a little
chunky. In a heavy bottom 2-quart saucepot, add the olive oil, over a
medium high flame and heat a little. Add the onions and saute until
slightly translucent. Add the garlic and saute about a minute until
golden. Quickly add the crushed tomatoes to the mix. Stir well and bring
to a simmer. Season with salt and pepper, to taste, and add the fresh
basil and oregano. You can add a touch of sugar if desired or if
tomatoes are tart. Simmer on a low flame, stirring often for at least 15
minutes. If not using right away, cool down and store in airtight
container in the refrigerator, up to 1 week.
