# Pan Roasted Steak

Courtesy of [Biscuits and

## Ingredients

-   1 lb strip steak (enough for 2)
-   1 tbsp kosher salt
-   1 tbsp black pepper

## Directions

Heat a cast iron pan over medium low heat (3 or 4 or a gas stove). Spray
with cooking oil and let the pan warm.

Pull out your steak and pat it down with a paper towel. Meat won’t get
that crisp edge that is essential for the perfect steak unless it is dry
when it touches the pan, so dabbing it down is essential. Sprinkle half
your salt & pepper on each side.

When your pan is hot, place the steak on the pan and set a timer for 12
minutes (for a steak about 1″ thick). When the 12 minutes is up, flip
the steak and reset the timer for another 12 minutes. During this time
you can also take the temperature and check the firmness. At the end of
the final 12 minutes, or when the inner temperature is 145 for medium
rare, remove the steak from heat. Set aside and let rest 10 minutes.

Carve and serve.
