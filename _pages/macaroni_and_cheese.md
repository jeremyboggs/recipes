# Macaroni & Cheese

From [Biscuits and
Such](http://biscuitsandsuch.com/2010/01/28/macaroni-cheese/)

## Ingredients

-   1 lb penne pasta
-   1 1/2 cups white cheddar cheese
-   1 cup extra sharp yellow cheddar cheese
-   1/2 cup parmesan cheese
-   4 tbsp flour
-   4 cups milk
-   1/2 cup heavy cream
-   1 tsp nutmeg
-   1/4 tsp cayenne pepper
-   1/2 tsp cinnamon
-   1/2 tsp paprika
-   1/2 tsp garlic powder
-   1/2 tsp salt
-   1/2 tsp pepper
-   1 small lemon, juiced
-   1/2 stick butter

## Directions

Shred all of your cheese. Measure out all your spices.

In a sauce pan, heat milk & cream over low/medium heat. If the pan gets
too hot, the milk will curdle.

In another pan, melt butter. Whisk in flour, making sure there are no
clumps. Slowly whisk in warm milk mixture. Remove from heat and add 3/4
of all the cheeses and the spices. Continue to stir until cheese has
melted and formed a sauce. The sauce should be thick enough to coat the
back of a spoon.

Boil your pasta 3-4 minutes until slightly cooked but still very firm.
Preheat your oven to 350.

Drain your pasta and pour into casserole dish. Pour cheese sauce over
and stir slightly to coat. Top with the remaining cheese, spread evenly
over the top. Bake for 35 minutes, or until the pasta is tender and the
cheese has a nice brown crust.
