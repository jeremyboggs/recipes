# Basic Tomato Sauce

From [Basic Tomato Sauce
Recipe](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/mario-batali/basic-tomato-sauce-recipe12/index.html)
on FoodNetwork.com

## Ingredients

-   1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
-   1 Spanish onion, 1/4-inch dice
-   4 garlic cloves, peeled and thinly sliced
-   3 tablespoons chopped fresh thyme leaves, or 1 tablespoon dried
-   1/2 medium carrot, finely grated
-   2 (28-ounce) cans peeled whole tomatoes, crushed by hand and juices
    reserved
-   Salt
-   Spaghetti, cooked al dente
-   Whole basil leaves, for garnish
-   Grated Parmesan, (optional)

## Directions

In a 3-quart saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the
onion and garlic, and cook until soft and light golden brown, about 8 to
10 minutes. Add the thyme and carrot, and cook 5 minutes more, until the
carrot is quite soft. Add the tomatoes and juice and bring to a boil,
stirring often. Lower the heat and simmer for 30 minutes until as thick
as hot cereal. Season with salt and serve. This sauce holds 1 week in
the refrigerator or up to 6 months in the freezer.

When ready to use, the cooked pasta should be added to a saucepan with
the appropriate amount of sauce. Garnish with basil leaves and cheese,
if using.
