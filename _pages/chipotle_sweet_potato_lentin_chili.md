INGREDIENTS

* 1 medium-size yellow onion, diced
* 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
* 1 bell pepper, cored and diced
* 1 jalapeno, cored and diced
* 4 garlic cloves, minced
* 1 tablespoon cumin
* 1 tablespoon paprika
* 1 tablespoon chili powder
* 1 tablespoon dried oregano
* 2 chipotle chilies in adobo sauce, finely diced
* 2 tablespoons adobo sauce from the can
* 1 (14.5 ounce) can diced fire roasted tomatoes, chopped up even more.
* 1 cup brown lentils, rinsed
* 4 cups vegetable broth
* 2 medium sweet potatoes, diced

(Note: I like to dice everything pretty small for this. I did the sweet potatoes to a 1/4‚Äù cube, more or less. Can make the diced things whatever size you prefer. If you like chunky, keep em chunky!)


INSTRUCTIONS

* Heat olive oil in a large stock pot or dutch oven over medium heat.

* Add onion, peppers, garlic, spices, and chiles with adobo diced bell pepper, jalapeno, garlic, spices and chilies with adobo sauce. Stir together and cook for 5-7 minutes, scraping up the brown bits.

* Add a bit of vegetable broth to the pot, to help get browned bits off bottom of the pot.
* Add lentils, diced tomatoes, sweet potatoes, and remaining vegetable broth
* Bring to a low boil, cover with a lid and cook for ~60 minutes, until lentils and sweet potatoes are tender.
* (Optional, but I like to do it) Take 1-2 cups of the chili out, and blend until smooth a blender, and add it back to the pot. Makes for a thicker chili.
