# Chicken Enchiladas

## Ingredients

-   Flour tortillias (6-8)
-   Shredded monterey jack cheese
-   Shredded lettuce
-   Diced tomatoes or pico de gallo

**Chicken Filling**

-   4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, about 1.5lbs total
-   1 4oz. can diced green chili peppers
-   1/2 cup chopped onion
-   5 cloves garlic, minced
-   1 Tbs Mexican oregano
-   1/2 tsp. cayenne pepper
-   1 10oz. can enchilada sauce

**Chile Enchilada Sauce**

-   1/4 cup reserved cooking liquid from chicken filling
-   2 10oz. cans enchilada sauce
-   1 4oz. can diced green chili peppers

## Directions

In a slow cooker, combine ingredients for chicken filling and cook for
2.5-3 hours on high or 5-6 hours on low. When chicken is cool, use forks
to shred chicken, and stir in enough of the reserved cooking liquid to
moisten.

In a rectangular baking dish, pour 1/2-1 cup of enchilada sauce to coat
bottom. Spoon chicken filling into each tortilla, roll up, and place in
dish with folds on bottom. Once all the tortillas are added, top with
remaining enchilada sauce. Bake covered at 350 degrees for 25 minutes.
Remove and uncover, and sprinkle with cheese, then bake for an
additional 5 minutes or until cheese melts. Serve with lettuce and
tomatoes.
