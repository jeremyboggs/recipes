# Sesame Noodles

## Ingredients

-   1/2 pound thin spaghetti or vermicelli
-   4 tablespoons Asian (toasted) sesame oil
-   1 bunch of scallions (about 6) chopped fine
-   2 garlic cloves, minced
-   1/4 teaspoon dried hot red pepper flakes, or to taste
-   1 tablespoon rice-wine vinegar
-   1 teaspoon sugar
-   1 tablespoon soy sauce
-   1/2 cup finely chopped salted dry-roasted peanuts
-   1/3 cup finely chopped fresh coriander plus, if desired, a coriander
    sprig for garnish

## Directions

In a kettle of boiling salted water cook the spaghetti until it is al
dente, drain it in a colander, and rinse it briefly under cold water.
Drain the spaghetti well and in a bowl toss it with 2 tablespoons of the
oil. In a large skillet cook the scallions, the garlic, and the red
pepper flakes in the remaining 2 tablespoons oil over moderate heat,
stirring, until the scallions are just softened, add the spaghetti, the
vinegar, the sugar, and the soy sauce, and heat the mixture, tossing it
to combine it well, until the spaghetti is heated through. Stir in the
peanuts and refrigerate until chilled. Remove and add chopped coriander,
and salt to taste, transfer the mixture to a serving bowl, and garnish
it with the coriander sprig.
