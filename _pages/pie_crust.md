# Pie Crust

From my aunt Charlene.

## Ingredients

-   4 cups plain flour
-   1 1/2 c crisco
-   1 1/2 tsp salt
-   1 tbsp sugar
-   1/2 c cold water
-   1 egg
-   1 tbsp vinegar

## Directions

Cut crisco into flour. Combine with other ingredients. It will make a
stiff dough. If it doesn't go together in a nice ball, add just a little
water. You don't want it to be sticky. Pinch off enough to make one
crust. Make it into a ball and place on a floured surface. Roll out
until slightly large than the pie pan. Place in the pan. Use a fork to
prick the crust 4 or 5 times. Use a fork to press the crust around the
edge of the pan. Repeat until all crusts are done. Bake at 350 until
golden brown. Don't let it get too brown.

This makes 5 8-8 1/4 inch pie crusts(This is what I use when I sell the
pies) 4 9" crusts 3 crusts for a glass pie plate. This also depends on
how thick you like your crusts also. I usually make half the recipe and
make 2 or 3 crusts, use what I want and freeze the rest. Put in the
freezer unbaked.
