# Chocolate Pie

From my aunt Charlene

## Ingredients

-   2 cups sugar
-   1/2 cup flour( heaping)
-   4 tbsp cocao
-   2 eggs (Separate the yolks and whites. Beat yolks slightly. Whites
    will be used for top of pie)
-   1 tsp vanilla
-   2 tbsp butter(margarine)
-   2 1/2 cups milk (Mix 1 can of cream with enough water to make 2 1/2
    cups of liquid)
-   1/4 tsp cream of tartar
-   1.5-2 Tbs sugar

## Directions

For the filling: Combine sugar, flour, and cocao until it is thoroughly
mixed. Add egg yolks, vanilla, butter, and milk, stirring well until it
is combined with no lumps. Place on burner. I turn it on high until the
butter melts. Stir constantly.(has a tendency to stick). Lower heat.
Continue to stir. It will thicken and start to bubble. Pour into cooled
[crust](Pie%20Crust).

For the meringue: Beat the 2 egg whites and 1/4 tsp cream of tartar
until very stiff. Add about 1 1/2 - 2 tbsp sugar. Beat some more. You
don't have to add the cream of tartar but it helps it not "cry" or get
moisture on the top. Pour the beaten egg whites on the top of the pie. I
usually drop spoonfuls and then spread it out all the way to the edge of
the crust. Place in a 350 degree oven. Let it get golden brown. You will
have to watch it and not let it burn.
