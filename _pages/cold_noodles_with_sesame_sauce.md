# Cold Noodles with Sesame Sauce

From
[Cookstr](http://www.cookstr.com/recipes/cold-noodles-with-sesame-sauce).

## Ingredients

-   1¼ pounds fresh Chinese egg noodles, or 1 pound linguine or
    spaghetti
-   1 tablespoon vegetable oil
-   7 tablespoons Chinese sesame paste or 100% natural peanut butter
-   2/3 cup warm water
-   6 tablespoons soy sauce
-   2 tablespoons rice wine vinegar
-   2 tablespoons sesame oil
-   ½ to 1 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper, or more to taste
-   1 tablespoon sugar
-   1 teaspoon salt
-   1 tablespoon finely chopped garlic
-   3 to 4 whole scallions, finely chopped
-   1 cucumber, peeled, seeded, and julienned
-   Fresh coriander leaves (optional)

## Directions

In about 5 quarts of boiling water salted with 1 rounded tablespoon
salt, cook the noodles until done to taste. Drain immediately and rinse
under cold running water until cooled. Place in a large bowl, drizzle
with the vegetable oil, and toss well. Refrigerate until ready to serve.

If the sesame paste or peanut butter has separated, drive a chopstick
repeatedly into it so you can mix the oil in sufficiently to stir,
although it needn’t be perfectly smooth at this point.

In a small mixing bowl, with a fork or small whisk, beat the sesame
paste or peanut butter together with the water until fairly smooth. Add
the soy sauce, vinegar, sesame oil, cayenne pepper, sugar, and salt.
Beat again until smooth.

Add the garlic and scallions, stir well, and let stand for at least 30
minutes, or until ready to serve.

(The sauce may be made several days ahead. Allow to return to room
temperature before tossing it with the noodles.)

Toss the noodles with about 1½ cups of the sauce.

Serve topped with the remaining sauce, the cucumber, and coriander, if
using.
