# Napa Cabbage Salad

## Ingredients

-   2 Heads of Napa Cabbage
-   1 Bunch of Green Onions
-   1 Package of Chinese Noodles (I use chow mein and rice noodles)
-   1 Stick or less of margarine (does not take a whole stick)
-   1 Cup of Almonds
-   1/2 Cup of Sesame Seeds
-   1 Cup of Vegetable Oil
-   1 Cup of Sugar
-   1/2 Cup of Cider Vinegar

## Directions

Tear cabbage by hand into small pieces. Chop green onion into small
pieces (using both white onion and stalk). Store in airtight container
and keep refrigerated. I dampen two paper towels and line the bottom of
the container and lay the second towel on top to keep cabbage crunchy.

Toast almonds and sesame seeds in margarine until light brown.

Combine vegetable oil, sugar and cider vinegar in medium size pot and
heat slowly while constantly stirring. This dissolves the sugar. I
usually add additional sesame seeds as well. Allow dressing to cool.

Just before serving, toss salad mixture with almond mixture. Stir
dressing well and toss into cabbage mixture.
