# Peppery White Cheddar Biscuits

## Ingredients

-   4 cups all-purpose flour
-   2 tablespoons baking powder
-   1/2 teaspoon salt
-   1/2 cup shortening
-   1/4 cup butter
-   1 1/2 cups shredded sharp white cheddar cheese (6 oz)
-   2-3 teaspoons coarse black pepper
-   1 1/2 cups milk
-   1 egg, lightly beaten
-   1 teaspoon water

## Directions

Preheat over to 400F. Lightly grease a large baking sheet; set aside. In
a large bowl, combine flour, baking powder, and salt. Cut in shortening
and butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in cheese and
pepper. Make a well in the center of the flour mixture. Add milk, and
stir until just moistened.

Turn dough onto lightly-floured surface. Knead dough 10-12 times or
until nearly smooth. Divide dough in half. Lightly roll or pat each half
into a 6-inch square about 1 inch thick. Using a sharp knife, cut each
dough square into 2-inch squares. Combine egg and water; brush over tops
of biscuits. Place dough squares on baking sheet.

Bake for 13-15 minutes or until golden. Remove biscuits from baking
sheet and serve warm.
