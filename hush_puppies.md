# Hush Puppies

From [Biscuits and
Such](http://biscuitsandsuch.com/2009/09/01/hush-puppies/)

## Ingredients

-   1 cup corn meal
-   1/2 cup flour
-   1 egg
-   1/2 cup buttermilk
-   Pinch of paprika
-   Pinch of cayenne
-   Pinch of garlic powder
-   Salt & pepper
-   Peanut oil for frying

## Directions

Begin by mixing dry ingredients. In a separate bowl, whisk together egg
and buttermilk. Combine wet and dry ingredients, and use your hands to
form 1/2″ round balls.

Heat your oil in a large skillet. You want your oil to be deep enough
that the puppies can be totally immersed. You’ll know when your oil is
hot enough if bubbles form around a wooden spoon.

Drop each ball into the fryer. Use a spoon to push them around so
they’re sure to get cooked on both side. Cook until golden brown- 3 or 4
minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and place on paper towels so they
can dry through and through.
