# Honey Chipotle Chicken

Adapted from [Dan's Fire in your Hole
Sandwich](http://biscuitsandsuch.com/2009/03/12/dans-fire-in-your-hole-sandwich/)

## Ingredients

-   1 chicken breast
-   2 tbsp chipotle chili powder
-   1 tsp garlic powder
-   2 tbsp olive oil
-   1 tsp hot sauce
-   1 tsp cinnamon
-   6 tbsp honey
-   Salt & pepper

## Directions

Pat your chicken dry on both sides and rub with chipotle, salt and
pepper, and cinnamon. Heat 2 tbsp oil. Stir in garlic powder and hot
sauce. Place your chicken in the pan and cook five minutes. Flip and
cook a additional five minutes.

Remove your chicken from the pan and slice into chunks. Return the
chunks to the pan and cook an additional two minutes. When your chicken
is fully cooked, pour honey into the pan. The honey will melt, and then
sizzle. Allow the honey to reduce.

While the honey is cooking, slice your bread. Top with havarti and
cilantro. When the honey has completely reduced, place the chicken into
the sandwich and serve.
