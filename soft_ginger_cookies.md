# Soft Ginger Cookies

## Ingredients

-   3 cups all-purpose flour
-   2 tsp. ground ginger
-   1 tsp baking soda
-   3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
-   1/2 tsp ground cloves
-   3/4 cup butter, softened
-   1 cup sugar
-   1 egg
-   1/4 cup mild-flavor molasses
-   2 tablespoons coarse baking sugar

## Directions

Preheat over to 350F.

In a medium bowl, combine flour, ginger, baking soda, cinnamon, and
cloves. Set aside.

In a large mixing bowl, beat butter with an electric mixer on medium to
high speed 30 seconds. Add 1 cup sugar. Beat until combined, scraping
the bowl occasionally. Beat in egg and molasses until combined. Beat in
as much of the flour as you can with the mixer, using a wooden spoon for
remaining flour mixture.

Shape dough into 1 1/2 inch balls, using a heaping tablespoon dough for
each. Roll balls into 2Tbs sugar. Place balls about 2.5 inches apart on
ungreased baking sheet. Bake about 10 minutes or until cookies are light
brown but still puffed. (Do not overbake.) Let stand on cookie sheets
for 2 minutes, then transfer to cooling racks.

Makes 2 dozen cookies.
