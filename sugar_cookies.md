# Sugar Cookies

## Ingredients

-   1 cup butter, softened
-   1 cup granulated sugar
-   1 tsp. baking powder
-   1/4 tsp. salt
-   1 egg
-   1 tsp vanilla
-   2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
-   1/4 cup colored or granulated sugar

## Directions

1.  In a large bowl, beat butter with mixer for 30 seconds. Add the 1
    cup sugar, baking powder, and salt. Beat until combined. Beat in egg
    and vanilla until combined. Beat in as much flour with the mixer as
    you can, using a spoon for remaining flour. If necessary, cover and
    refrigerate 30-60 minutes or until dough is easy to handle.
2.  Preheat over to 300F. Shape dough into 1-inch balls. Roll balls in
    1/4 cup sugar. Place balls 2 inches apart on ungreased cookie
    sheets.
3.  Bake about 15 minutes or until tips are slightly crackled and sides
    are set. (Do not let edges brown.) Transfer cookies to wire racks
    for cooling.

(Makes \~5 dozen cookies.)
